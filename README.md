# SMAR
A shelf management app for Android smart glasses using augmented reality.

### About SMAR
SMAR stands for _Shelf Management Augmented Reality_ and supports workers in retail stores with shelf management â€“ receiving and registering incoming goods, filling up shelves, finding products and their locations, and inventury taking.
The app for SMAR is built on Android and optimized for smart glasses, so that the user still has free hands for work.

SMAR was built on Vuzix M100 smart glasses, can be controlled by voice or touch input on the smart glasses, and utilizes the included barcode scanner to recognize products.

This app should be seen as an MVP or prototype to test the capabilities of smart glasses in practice.

### Backend and database
To use SMAR, it is necessary to run the [SMAR Web Administration](https://github.com/pianomister/SMAR-Web-Administration) backend in addition. It allows to add and edit shelf layouts and products, and manage deliveries and stock.
